This is the Fovus Coding Challenge. The goal of this full stack site is to allow a user to input text and upload a file, and uses a database to store these values.

The specific components of this project are:
1. React Frontend - User interface built with React where the user can input text and choose an image
2. AWS S3 - A service that stores the uploaded files
3. AWS DynamoDB - A NoSQL database that will save the input text and file paths
4. AWS Lambda - Serverless compute service that processes the input data and manages the file uploads.
5. AWS EC2 - Cloud computing service where a Virtual Machine (VM) runs the script.
